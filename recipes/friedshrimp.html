        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lbs extra large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1.2 cup all-purpose flour (preferably unbleached)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 large eggs (or 3 if needed)</li>
            <li>2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (about 8 cups)</li>
            <li>Parslet and lemon wedges for serving (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk dry ingredients: Add flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper to a medium shallow dish and whisk to blend (I use about 1 1/4 tsp salt and 3/4 tsp pepper).</li>
                <li>Blend egg white and yolks: In a second medium shallow dish whisk eggs until well blended.</li>
                <li>Add panko to a dish: Pour panko into a 3rd shallow dish (a pie plate works well here).</li>
                <li>Heat oil in pot: Preheat vegetable oil in a large pot to 350 degrees while you coat shrimp. Note that shrimp should be wet on the exterior (I use frozen shrimp and upon thawing it’s wet, if not rinse with water and drain well otherwise the flour won’t stick in the next step).</li>
                <li>Dredge shrimp through three coatings: Dredge shrimp in flour mixture on both sides. Transfer to egg mixture and coat on both sides. Then finish by coating in panko on both sides, while pressing into panko so it adheres well.</li>
                <li>Fry shrimp in batches: Cook shrimp in batches (no more than 10 at a time) until just cooked through. Bring oil back to 350 degree temperature between batches.</li>
                <li>Remove shrimp: Use a large spider to remove shrimp from oil and transfer to a baking sheet lined with two layers of paper towels to drain. Repeat process with remaining shrimp.</li>
                <li>Serve: Garnish shrimp with parsley if desired, serve with lemon wedges and your favorite shrimp dip (such as cocktail sauce, honey mustard, tartar sauce, sriracha dip, creamy herb etc).</li>
            </ol>
