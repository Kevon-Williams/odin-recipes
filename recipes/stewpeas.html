            <li>1 lb smoked turkey necks or turkey tails, wings, ham hocks, etc</li>
            <li>2 cups dried kidney beans soaked overnight in 4 cups water or two 15 oz canned beans, undrained*</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion chopped</li>
            <li>2 green onions</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme or 2 springs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>15 oz can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic chopped</li>
            <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add soaked kidney beans, 3 cups of the water the beans soaked in, a can of coconut milk, turkey necks, onions, garlic, and thyme to a pressure cooker.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook on high pressure for 35 minutes, then allow the machine to naturally release for 10 minutes before releasing the remaining pressure.</li>
            <li>While your machine is naturally releasing, start to make your spinners. Add all-purpose flour and ½ teaspoon salt to a bowl and stir to combine. Slowly add in enough water until a smooth ball is formed. Pinch off small pieces of dough and roll them into a cylinder.</li>
            <li>Once all the pressure has been released on your pressure cooker, open it and press sauté on the machine. Once the mixture begins to simmer, add in the spinners and the whole scotch bonnet pepper and allow the stew to simmer for 5-7 minutes until the dumplings are cooked.</li>
            <li>Remove the pepper and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with white or brown rice. Enjoy!</li>
